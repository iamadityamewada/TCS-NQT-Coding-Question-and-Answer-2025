* API Integration: For Detectify, how did you work with AWS Rekognition API? How did you handle requests and responses?
* Challenges Faced & Solutions: This shows problem-solving skills.
* Learnings: What new skills or insights did you gain?
* Live Demos: Ensure they are working. Be prepared to walk through them.
* GitHub Repos: Make sure they are clean and well-documented.





6. Internship Experience (Tech SimPlus Learning  & Cisco ):
* Tech SimPlus Learning (Full Stack Intern) :
* Elaborate on "Built React components, pages, and integrated APIs for CRUD functionality". Give specific examples.
* Detail the "JWT authentication" implementation.
* Discuss your experience with "React.js, Next.js, FastAPI, and Node.js" in this professional setting. What was different from personal projects?
* Cisco Networking Academy (Virtual Internship) :
* Discuss "networking concepts" you learned and your experience with "Cisco Packet Tracer".
* Be ready for basic networking questions: OSI model, TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS port numbers (as in example), types of networks. Your "Networking Essential Certificate"  will be relevant here.



7. Deployment & Tools:
* Deployment (Vercel, Railway ): How do these platforms work? How did you deploy your apps? Any CI/CD aspects?
* Docker (basic) : Understand what Docker is, its benefits (containerization, consistent environments). If you know basic commands, mention them.

II. Managerial Round Preparation:
This will likely focus on your projects, problem-solving approach, and teamwork.

Project Deep Dives: Be prepared for extensive cross-questioning on your projects  as mentioned above.



Technical Choices & Justifications: Why certain technologies? What were the trade-offs?
Problem-Solving & Practical Skills:
"How do you validate data in an API?" (From example). Relate to your projects with JWT and CRUD.

How did you debug issues in your projects/internship?
Internship Learnings: Focus on what you learned about working in a team, deadlines, and professional development at Tech SimPlus.
Understanding of ML (if it comes up): The example had "What is Machine Learning (ML)?" You used AWS Rekognition, which is an ML service. Understand its purpose even if you didn't build the model.
III. HR Round Preparation:
Focus on your personality, communication, and fit for TCS.

"Tell me about yourself": Craft a narrative: Your BSc, MCA, passion for full-stack (mention key skills ), internship highlights, and career aspirations.


Strengths: Your technical skills, project portfolio, internship experience, certifications, eagerness to learn. Your CGPA in MCA (8.51)  is good; your BSc (67%)  is lower, so be prepared to show your growth trajectory and how you've excelled in MCA if it comes up.




Weaknesses: Frame them constructively (e.g., "I'm working on improving my depth in advanced Next.js features," or "While I have basic knowledge of Docker, I am planning to explore it more deeply").
"Why TCS?": Research TCS's work, values, and opportunities in areas like full-stack development, cloud, etc.
Behavioral Questions:
Teamwork: "If you are working in a team... two teammates fall sick..." (from the example). Prepare scenarios using the STAR method.
Handling challenges, pressure, failures.
Career Goals: Align with growing as a software developer within a reputable company like TCS.
Flexibility: Be clear about relocation, shifts (if asked).
Company Knowledge: Basic facts about TCS (CEO, recent projects/news). "TCS’s current technologies" was an HR question in the example.
Specific Questions to Anticipate (Based on Your Resume + Example):
Walk me through the architecture of your GroceryWise app. Why did you choose Next.js with FastAPI?
Explain the JWT authentication flow you implemented in BlogHub  and your internship.

How did you handle state management in your React projects (BlogHub, Detectify )?

You've used both PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Compare them and tell me when you'd choose one over the other, perhaps using your projects as examples.
What are the core differences between Express.js and FastAPI? Why might you choose one over the other for a new project?
You mentioned "responsive web applications" in your summary  and have a certification in Responsive Web Design. What are the key principles you follow?

What did you specifically contribute during your internship at Tech SimPlus Learning regarding React components and API integration?
